once upon a time jacotie, the slime, and protagonist of our, brief but exciting, tale. The first thing you have to understand about jacotie is that he was no ordinary slime, not that there can really be said to be an 'ordinary' slime, slimes after containing within their number a great many different shapes sizes textures and colors. However jacotie differed from other slimes not in his height or hue but in his hubris.
Jacotie wanted glory, he wanted fame, he wanted the adoration of billions of microbes. he wanted to be a man, with all the adjectives that go along with it, even the shitty ones. He set off on a quest for knowledge of humanity, going to the great library of alex. 
It was to be a long and hard quest, he would have to pass through the palace of pleasure, the natal pits, the godtooth mountains, the finger lakes and the ear of the earth, a particularly narrow underground passage, tragically the only way to get from france to alex in under a month.
oh yeah, slimes only live one year and he just hit 11 months.
